/**
 * @brief A KisActionManager class keeps track of KisActions.
 * These actions are always associated with the GUI. That means each MainWindow
 * will create its own duplicate of these actions.
 *
 * KisActionManager enables and disables actions, to grey out buttons according
 * to the state of the application.
 *
 * Some of the primitive actions (load/save and so on) are not defined as
 * KisActions, but instead KActions, automacially registered through KXMLGUI.
 * It tracks these actions through the KActionCollection owned by the window.
 * Ultimately it would be nice to unify these things more fully.
