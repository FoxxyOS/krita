 * canvas.

 * The Input Manager keeps track of a set of actions and a set of
 * shortcuts. The actions are pre-defined while the shortcuts are
 * set from configuration.
 *
 * For each event, it will try to determine if there is a shortcut that
 * matches the input. It will then activate this action and pass all
 * consecutive events on to this action.
