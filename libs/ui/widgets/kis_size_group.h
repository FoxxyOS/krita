/**
 * KisSizeGroup provides a mechanism to group widgets together so they all
 * request the same amount of space. Also, the widgets will share the same
 * amount of minimum space. The mode of KisSizeGroup determines the direction of
 * the space that are affected by the size group.
 *
 * All widgets inside of KisSizeGroup will use the same size hint value, computed
 * as the maximum of all of his size hint values. The same value is used for the
 * minimum size of all widgets. When KisSizeGroup ignore hidden widgets, the
 * size of widgets that are not visible don't count in the computation of the
 * current size value. When one of these widgets becomes visible again, a new
 * size value is computed and applied to all visible widgets.
 *
 * KisSizeGroup cannot share the same widget with other size groups, so one
 * widget can be in one, and only one, KisSizeGroup at time.
 *
 * NOTE: Added widgets in size groups must be laid out inside of a valid
 * layout. The current implementation sopports widgets laid out inside of
 * QGridLayout, QFormLayout and QBoxLayout. If the parent widget layout is not
 * one of them, then the group size will not affect the widget size.
