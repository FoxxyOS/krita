/** This class exists to work around a bug in QToolButton when in
  * MenuPopupButton mode. The correct (mouse) behavior is to display
  * the menu with the first click, and let the user choose an item with
  * the next click. The buggy behavior presented by the tablet is to
  * present the menu and immediately select an item when the user
  * performs a stylus tip click. This workaround solves this.
