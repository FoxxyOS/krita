/**
 * You are now reading a beautiful solution to a hideous abstraction. The old
 * Calligra suite developed text interaction methods that were intended to be
 * appropriate for an entire suite of office apps at once. This tool hooks up
 * Krita to the two old text interaction methods, one designed to be like a word
 * processor for a paragraph of text ("texttool"), the other designed to make a
 * very pretty single line of text ("artistictexttool"), and squishes them
 * together into a single digital-painting wrapper. Surprisingly, the base class
 * is KisToolRectangle. This is because the first interaction the user makes
 * will be drawing an outline for the text area. After the shape is drawn, the
 * rectangle tool will deactivate, switching to one of the two text tools
 * which will be used to interact with the new shape on canvas.
 *
 * I call "not dibs" on cleaning this up.
 *
 * TODO: Disallow the appearance of the Artistic Text Shape tool in the toolbox.
