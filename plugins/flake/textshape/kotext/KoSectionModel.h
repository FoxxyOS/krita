/**
 * Used to handle all the sections in the document
 *
 * Now there actually two levels of section handling:
 * 1) Formatting Level: on this level we should be sure, that
 * pointers to KoSection and KoSectionEnd in the KoParagraphStyles
 * properties SectionEndings and SectionStartings are consistent.
 * Handling on this level is provided on the level of text editing
 * commands: DeleteCommand, NewSectionCommand
 * We can't move it to another place, because we should know the
 * semantics of operation to handle it right way.
 * 2) Model(Tree) Level: on this level we should update KoSectionModel
 * right way, so it in any moment represents the actual tree
 * of sections. Tree is builded easily:
 *    One section is son of another, if it is directly nested in it.
 * As text editing commands have access to change Formatting Level,
 * they are declared as friend classes of KoSectionModel to be able
 * affect Model structure without changing something on Formatting
 * Level. Also affected by RenameSectionCommand.
 *
 * Also we need to look at the consistency of some section properties:
 *
 * 1) Bounds. Those now are handled with QTextCursors that are placed
 * on start and end of the section. In default state start cursor
 * isn't moving if text inserted in its position, and end cursor
 * moves. But in the case of initial document loading, it is necessary
 * to make some end cursors stop moving, so we have:
 *         KoTextLoader -> calling -> KoSection::setKeepEndBound()
 *         KoTextLoader -> calling -> KoSectionModel::allowMovingEndBound()
 *      ^-- this needed to restore defaul behaviour after load
 *
 * 2) Level. Level means the depth of the section in tree. Root
 * sections has 0 (zero) level. Now if you look at the possible
 * text editing command affecting sections you may notice that
 * level of section doesn't change in any case. Initial level
 * is set in KoSection constructor as parent's level plus one.
 * TODO: write about drag-n-drop here, when its implemented
 *
 * 3) Name. Each KoSection has a name that must be unique. We have
 * two groups of KoSections in each moment of time: the first group
 * consists of the sections that are present in document now,
 * the second group consists of the sections that were deleted, but
 * we still need them as they may be restored with "undo".
 * This groups are stored in m_registeredSections and m_sectionNames.
 *
 * Sections are created through this newSection() and newSectionEnd()
 * functions.
 *
 * This object is created for QTextDocument on the first query of it.
